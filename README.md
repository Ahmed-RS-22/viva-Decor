✨ Features

Services Section – Highlights key services (lighting, interior, exterior design) with minimalist icons.

Showcase & Steps Section – Displays featured projects and a simple 3-step process (Start Project → Craft → Execute) to communicate workflow.

Customer Testimonials – Adds credibility with a styled section featuring client reviews.

Call to Action – Strategically placed buttons to encourage user interaction (“Start Project”, “Learn More”).

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 for semantic structure

CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, responsive design techniques) for layout and styling

JavaScript for scroll-triggered animations (Intersection Observer API)

🚀 How It Works

As the user scrolls, the Intersection Observer API detects when elements enter the viewport.

CSS classes are toggled dynamically to trigger fade-in, slide, and reveal animations, making the browsing experience smooth and interactive.

Layout and typography scale fluidly across devices for a consistent visual experience.

📌 Purpose

This project demonstrates a real-world landing page setup with interactive animations and a strong focus on UI/UX design. It can be used as:

A template for businesses in the creative or interior design industry.

A personal project to showcase front-end development skills in responsive design and animation.
